## Development Plan
The plan was to make something along the lines of Github Issues, but with less formality and complexity. I wanted to keep the application intentionally simple in order to allow it to be used in many different environments, not just on collaborative programming projects. 

The data is stored in a document database (MongoDB) due to it's relative simplicity. The back-end routes and schemas are viewable [here](https://github.com/sidhantmathur/issue-api). 

## User Stories

- A user should be able to create an issue. 
- A user should be able to comment on issues. 
- A user should be able to assign a tag to their issues. 
- A user should be able to see all their issues. 
- A user should be able to add images/code to a comment.
